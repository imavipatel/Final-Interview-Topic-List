# Introduction

There are numerous CSS frameworks available today, each with its unique offerings. Selecting the right CSS framework among these options can be challenging, as most users are unsure which framework best suits their web development project.

In this article, we will compare two of the most popular CSS frameworks - Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. You'll learn about their key features, design philosophies, and the CSS customization options for each one. Also, apart from that, you'll get familiar with the developer experience, performance, and support from the community for each of the frameworks.

By the end of this article, you will know the ins and outs of each framework in detail to decide which CSS framework best fits your needs for a project.

Let's get into it!

# Overview of Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS

**Bootstrap**

**Bootstrap** is a widely-used, open-source CSS framework focused on simplifying the development of responsive, mobile-first websites. Created by Twitter engineers Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton in 2011, Bootstrap offers a robust toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Key Features:

- **Pre-designed Components:** Offers a vast array of UI elements like buttons, forms, navbars, and modals.
- **Responsive Grid System:** Utilizes a 12-column grid system to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Extensive Documentation:** Provides comprehensive guides and examples for easy learning.
- **Community Support:** Boasts a large community with numerous third-party themes and plugins.

# Tailwind CSS

**Tailwind CSS** is a modern utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without leaving your HTML (inline styling).
CSS was initially developed by Adam Wathan. Since its release in 2017, Tailwind CSS has gained popularity for offering developers full control over styling without writing custom CSS.

**Key Features:**

- **Utility-First Approach:** Offers a vast collection of utility classes for styling directly in your markup.
- **Customization:** Highly customizable through configuration files, allowing you to tailor the design to your needs.
- **Responsive Design:** Built-in support for responsive variants to adjust styles based on screen sizes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Features like PurgeCSS integration help reduce the final CSS bundle size.

# Speed Comparison

Tailwind has a JIT compiler that allows you to really optimize file size and speed at which the page is rendered. A big drawback of Bootstrap is that even if you aren’t going to be using modals and accordions to make your website, you still have to load all of the required files. Even after minifying all of the requirements, Bootstrap is around 308.25kb. Compared to Tailwinds 27kb, Tailwind is going to be able to render way faster.

**How do I decide between Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS based on my specific project needs?**

Think about what's most important for your project:

- If you need to change designs a lot, Tailwind CSS might be better.
- If your website needs to work on older internet browsers, Bootstrap could be a safer bet.
- If you're worried about your website loading slowly, Tailwind CSS is more efficient since it removes unused styles.
- For simpler websites, Bootstrap might be easier.
- If you're in a rush to build, Bootstrap helps you get things done faster.
- If your team is new to CSS, Bootstrap is simpler to start with.

# Performance and Bundle Size

In this section, we'll compare Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS to see which framework significantly influences page load times and bundle size.

**Impact on Page Load Times**
Bootstrap's pre-built CSS and JavaScript components tend to be large, potentially slowing page load times. You should only include the necessary components to minimize the bundle size, resulting in faster page load times.

Tailwind CSS, on the other hand, has a relatively faster page load time because it generates CSS on-demand according to the utility class used.

**Bundle size analysis**

**1. File size evaluation**

Bootstrap's bundle size can be larger than Tailwind CSS's. Below is a screenshot of the bundle size generated by both frameworks.

**2. Optimization Techniques**

Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS offer optimization techniques to reduce bundle size and improve performance. You can minimize bundle size across both frameworks by Tree-Shaking, which is a process that involves purging unused CSS files from your .css file.

Bootstrap can also be optimized further by Minification. (Tree-shaking, Minification (.min.css and .min.js files))

**What are the downsides of Tailwind?**

Some challenges with Tailwind CSS include:

- It can make your HTML look cluttered with lots of class names.
- There's a bit of a learning curve if you're used to different ways of doing CSS.
- Without careful planning, designs can become inconsistent.
- You might end up with a bigger file size if you don't clean up unused styles.
- Even though Tailwind has these challenges, many developers find its benefits worth it.

# Conclusion

I think that if you are tackling a small project and are okay with the idea of creating a lot of the components yourself, you should be open to trying out Tailwind. Just messing around with it so far, it does save you from having to write a bunch of css code. The benefit isn’t the code however, the benefit is the JIT compilation and small file sizes. Bootstrap is way over bloated and can’t easily be paired down so it’s unlikely to change at this point. It might come down to preference, but knowing that options like this exist are fun!
